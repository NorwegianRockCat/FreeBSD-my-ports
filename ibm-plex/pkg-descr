IBM Plex is IBM's new corporate typeface.

It’s global, it’s versatile and it’s distinctly IBM.

From the Github webpage:

We designed Plex carefully to both meet our needs as a global tech
company and express who we are as people. It took two years and a lot
of work to get here, but today we have a signature typeface we’re
proud and excited to share with the world. Plex is an open-source
project (OFL) and free to download and use. The Plex family comes in a
Sans, Serif, Mono and Sans Condensed, all with roman and true
italics. The fonts have been designed to work well in user interface
(UI) environments as well as other mediums.
