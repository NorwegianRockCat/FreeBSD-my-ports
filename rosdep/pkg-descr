Taken from the rosdep documentation.

rosdep is a command-line tool for installing system dependencies. For
*end-users*, rosdep helps you install system dependencies for software
that you are building from source. For *developers*, rosdep simplifies
the problem of installing system dependencies on different platforms.

On FreeBSD, the pkg system is used.
